## IPFS

### Question 1

IPFS link : https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRHhKss9MmKH32PuMcs7nJEU7hiBKJbNDESn3dpfLhydv
CID : QmRHhKss9MmKH32PuMcs7nJEU7hiBKJbNDESn3dpfLhydv

### Question 2

When i create my IPFS file the changing between torrent and IPFS is that we need the hash of the file to download it. It assures the integrity of the file when we download it.

### Question 3

We can see that the copy and the original have the same CID : QmRHhKss9MmKH32PuMcs7nJEU7hiBKJbNDESn3dpfLhydv. It differs with torrent where the two torrent of the different folders have different Hash for example.
